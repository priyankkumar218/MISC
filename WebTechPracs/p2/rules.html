			Your rights are about being treated fairly and treating others fairly, and 
			having the ability to make choices about your own life. 
			<b> These basic human rights are: </b> </p>
			<ul type="square" class="ul">
				<li class="li">Universal They belong to all of us – everybody in the world</li>
				<li class="li">Inalienable They cannot be taken away from us</li>
				<li class="li">Indivisible and interdependent Governments should not be able to pick and choose which are respected</li>
				<li class="li">Human Rights can be violated Although they are inalienable, they are not invulnerable. Violations can stop people from enjoying their rights, 
					but they do not stop the rights from existing.</li>
				<li class="li">Human Rights are essential They are essential for freedom, justice, and peace.</li>
